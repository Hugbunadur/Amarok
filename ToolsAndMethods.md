#####Trello

*"Trello is an online tool for managing projects and personal tasks. That may sounds rather prosaic. But this increasingly popular app often inspires the sort of passion usually reserved for consumer apps like Pinterest or Instagram. Itâ€™s the kind of business software that slips into businesses through the backdoor, just because individual employees like how it works."*

#####Scrum

*"Scrum is an iterative and incremental [agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) framework for managing product development. It defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal", challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach" to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project."*
